# Ledger

The goal of this addon is to keep track of all the items that all characters have on an account and what cost it took to get it


## Things to consider

### Ingress of items
- mail from other characters (especially yourself)
- auction buys
- vendor buys
- gathered (considered free)
- quest reward (rare, but may want to consider)

### Egress of items
- mail sent
- auction sells (weird case to handle about active auctions since they aren't on person)
    - Should consider
